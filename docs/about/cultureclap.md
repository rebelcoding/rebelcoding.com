# About Culture Clap

A social disruptor uplifting the neglected and amplifying the ignored.

I am a multi-disciplinary participant of life, artist, entrepreneur & educator; each aspect helping to balance another. I help others build systems of equilibrium for their own pursuits, in an otherwise chaotic world.
