# About Rebel Coding

> Teaching Code to Those Outside the System

Rebel Coding is a learning platform, and series of guides, designed to onboard new developers.

What makes Rebel Coding unique is that the curriculum is built around an application for civic engagement.

Readers are able to both learn to code, while making contributions to an open-source application that can be replicated to serve their community.

Aligned with an ethos of education and transparency, below are also all of our marketing plans and documents.

Beyond helping people learn to code, we aspire to help people build their lives in this ever-evolving digital era, and so we make this information available as well.
