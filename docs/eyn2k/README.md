# Everything You Need to Know

###  To Start Coding & Grow Beyond

Last things first!

A huge part of learning is your own internal drive ~ and we need to make sure that before we begin we have a nice shiney light at the end of our educational tunnel.

When we reach it, you’re going to have the tools to continue your tech journey beyond the light; wherever it may take you!

While now you have a community too, if you’d like, for whenever you’ve got a question along the way.

So without any further ado, let’s get started!
