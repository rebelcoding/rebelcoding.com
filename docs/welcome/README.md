# Welcome to Rebel Coding!

::: warning
This is a work in progress, released before completion. Copies of the book [Just the Basics](https://gum.co/RebelCoding) are available for purchase, covering steps 1-4. Though steps 5-8 and the appendices are still being constructed, albeit publicly.

Thank you so much for venturing this way and exploring my materials.

My name is Canin Carlos, notoriously known as [Culture Clap](/about/cultureclap) on the net.

What follows is an ever growing guide to web development, open-source software, and a bit more.

These guides are meant to help readers to begin building projects as soon as possible.

I hope these materials are able to help you grow as much as writing them continues to help me.

If you'd like to purchase a PDF or eReader copy, those are available through Gumroad.

Or if you'd just like to [toss me a couple bucks for coffee or a sammich](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cultureclap); you can also support me through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CultureClap) starting at $1 per month.

Any and all support is super appreciated.
