# Welcome to Rebel Coding!

::: warning
This is a work in progress, released before completion. Copies of the book [Just the Basics](https://gum.co/RebelCoding) are available for purchase, covering steps 1-4. Though steps 5-8 and the appendices are still being constructed, albeit publicly.

Thank you so much for venturing our way and exploring or materials.

My name is Canin Carlos, though on the internets I go by the moniker Culture Clap.

What follows is an ever growing guide to web development and open-source software.

I hope you enjoy, and these materials are able to help you grow too.

If you'd like to purchase a PDF or eReader copy, they are available through Gumroad.

Or if you'd just like to [toss me a couple bucks for coffee or a sammich](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cultureclap), that would be super appreciated as well.
