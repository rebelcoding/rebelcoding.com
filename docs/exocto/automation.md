# Automation 101

Itâ€™s a hot word these days, and surprisingly serves a tangible purpose!

Make a TikTok, share it as a story to Instagram & Facebook; post it as a video to Twitter :) Or you can use tools to automate this process.

There are many ways to do this, and a growing number of platforms one might like to reach.
