# The Exo-CTO Files

Here I provide a straight-forward guide highlighting all of the necessities of launching a digital brand, or presence. It is presumed that you already have a product in mind.

That products can range from writing to art to merchandise or services.

Your next step is to build awareness of your product or service; and provide a place for people to learn more.

Websites can be as cheap or as expensive as you like. Static websites can cost as little as a few cents per month, or complete CMSâ€™s or applications can cost tens to hundreds to thousands of dollars per month to run.

Though there is much more to building a presence than merely building a website.

We will cover analytics, search engine optimization, and more throughout this essay.

So strap in and enjoy the ride!
